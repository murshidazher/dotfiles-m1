## Vscode Permission error when installing extensions

Permission error encountered when updating vscode extensions,

```sh
sudo chown -R $(whoami):staff $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/CodeCachedExtensionVSIXs
sudo chown -R $(whoami):staff $HOME/.vscode/extensions/*
```

## Vscode error for Python

When attempting to launch vscode using the `code .` command you might get the following error,

```sh
/usr/local/bin/code: line 10: ./MacOS/Electron: No such file or directory
```

This most likely occurs because of error in python path, symlink the python path manually,

```sh
sudo ln -s -f $(which python2) $(which python)
```
